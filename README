== me-money

me-money is my feeble attempt to sort out my money. I need to write a simple
program that helps me get to grips with my spending and allows me to actually
save and spend more peacefully.

== to-do

The following are features that I need to implement to be useful for me:

 * transfer money between accounts
 * zero-based budgets
 * daily spending on holiday
 * spending warnings
