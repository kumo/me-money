Story: creating a zero balanced budget
  As a conscientious spender
  I want to create a zero balanced budget
  So that I know where I all money should go
  
  Scenario: money left over
    Given my budget income is 100 euros
    And a budget category is 80 euros
    When I create a new category of 10 euros
    Then my budget expenses should be 90 euros
    And my budget should have 10 euros left
    And my budget should not be ready
    And I should see that I have 10 euros left to allocate
  
  Scenario: balanced out
    Given my budget income is 100 euros
    And my budget category is 80 euros
    When I create a new category of 20 euros
    Then my budget expenses should be 100 euros
    And my budget should have 0 euros left
    And my budget should be ready
    And I should see that I have 0 euros left to allocate
  
  Scenario: over allocated
    Given my budget income is 100 euros
    And a budget category is 80 euros
    When I create a new category of 30 euros
    Then my budget expenses should be 110 euros
    And my budget should have 0 euros left
    And my budget should not be ready
    And I should see a warning message
    And I should see that I have 10 euros left to allocate
