Story: dealing with a debt
  As an ex-student
  I want to pay off my student loans
  So that I can finally break free
  
  Scenario: allocating some money to the debt
    Given a debt named 'student loan'
    And the debt is for 300 euros
    When I allocate 100 euros for the debt
    Then I should need to allocate 200 euros more
    And I should have 300 euros left to pay
    And the debt should not be covered
    
  Scenario: allocating too much money
    Given a debt named 'student loan'
    And the debt is for 300 euros
    When I allocate 400 euros for the debt
    Then I should need to allocate 0 euros more
    And the debt should be covered
    And the debt should be over-allocated
  
  Scenario: paying something off
    Given a debt named 'student loan'

    When I pay off 100 euros from the debt
    Then I should have 200 euros left to pay
    And I should have 150 euros left to allocate
    And the debt should not be covered
  
  Scenario: paying it all off
