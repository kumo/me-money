Story: applying limitations to an account
  As a consumer
  I want to store money in different locations
  So that I don't need to carry loose change
  
  Scenario: non-transferrable
    Given an account named 'electronic key'
    And an account named 'wallet'
    And the account is non-transferrable
    And the account has 5 euros in it
    When I start a new transfer
    Then I should not see the 'electronic key' in the list
  
  Scenario: minimum amount
