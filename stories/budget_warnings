Story: budget warnings
  As a budget user
  I want to receive warnings when there are things to watch out for
  So that I can pro-actively deal with my money
  
  Scenario: overspent
    Given my 'food' budget category has 30 euros dedicated to it
    And the budget category has 0 euros left
    When I spend 10 euros in that category
    Then I should see a warning for that budget category
  
  Scenario: not enough money left
    Given my 'food' budget category has 30 euros dedicated to it
    And the budget category has 3 euros left
    And I always spend at least 5 euros in that category
    When I view my dashboard
    Then I should see a warning for the 'food' budget category
