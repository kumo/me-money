Story: modifying existing entries
  As a mere mortal
  I want to able to fix mistakes that I have made
  So that I don't have to start from scratch each time
  
  Scenario: changing description
    Given an account named 'wallet'
    And the account has 50 euros in it
    And the account has an entry for 30 euros named 'sushi'
    When I change the entry description to 'inarizushi'
    Then I should see the entry
    And the account balance should still be 50 euros
    And the entry should now be called 'inarizushi'
    And the entry amount should still be 30 euros

  Scenario: making amount smaller
    Given an account named 'wallet'
    And the account has 50 euros in it
    And the account has an entry for 30 euros named 'sushi'
    When I change the entry amount to 20 euros
    Then I should see the entry
    And the account balance should now be 60 euros
    And the entry amount should now be 20 euros
    And the entry should still be called 'sushi'

  Scenario: making amount bigger
    Given an account named 'wallet'
    And the account has 50 euros in it
    And the account has an entry for 30 euros named 'sushi'
    When I change the entry amount to 80 euros
    Then I should see the entry
    And the account balance should now be 0 euros
    And the entry amount should now be 80 euros
    And the entry should still be called 'sushi'

  Scenario: deleting an entry
    Given an account named 'wallet'
    And the account has 50 euros in it
    And the account has an entry for 30 euros named 'sushi'
    When I delete the entry
    Then I should see the list of entries
    And the account balance should now be 80 euros
