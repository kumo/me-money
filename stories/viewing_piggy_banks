Story: viewing piggy banks
  As a money saver
  I want to check on my saving up
  So that I can see if everything is going to plan
  
  Scenario: piggy bank due today
    Given a piggy bank named 'Holiday'
    And the piggy bank has a goal of 300 euros
    And the piggy bank has 250 euros in it
    And the piggy bank is due today
    When I view the piggy bank
    Then I should see the piggy bank
    And I should see that there are 0 days left
    And I should see that there are 50 euros to go
