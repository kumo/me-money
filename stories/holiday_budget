Story: holiday budget
  As a traveller
  I want to create a holiday budget
  So that I don't spend all my money on souvenirs
  
  Scenario: normal overspending
    Given today's allocation for 'food' is 70 euros
    And today's allocation for 'souvenirs' is 30 euros
    And today's allocation for 'entertainment' is 20 euros
    When I overspend by 10 euros on 'food'
    And I overspend by 10 euros on 'souvenirs'
    And I overspend by 10 euros on 'hotel'
    Then today's remaining budget should be 0 euros

  Scenario: money left over
    Given today's allocation for 'food' is 70 euros
    And today's allocation for 'souvenirs' is 30 euros
    And today's allocation for 'entertainment' is 20 euros
    When I spend 60 euros on 'food'
    And I spend 5 euros on 'souvenirs'
    And I spend 10 euros on 'entertainment'
    Then today's remaining budget should be 20 euros
    And today's remaining allocation for 'food' should be 10 euros
    And today's remaining allocation for 'souvenirs' should be 25 euros
    And today's remaining allocation for 'entertainment' should be 10 euros

  Scenario: daily limit cannot be broken
    Given today's allocation for 'food' is 70 euros
    And today's allocation for 'souvenirs' is 30 euros
    And today's allocation for 'entertainment' is 20 euros
    And today's allocation is fixed
    When I spend 95 euros on 'food'
    Then today's remaining budget should be 25 euros
  
  Scenario: daily limit is enforced for all categories
    Given today's allocation for 'food' is 70 euros
    And today's allocation for 'souvenirs' is 30 euros
    And today's allocation for 'entertainment' is 20 euros
    And today's allocation is fixed
    When I spend 95 euros on 'food'
    Then today's remaining allocation for 'food' should be 0 euros
    And today's remaining allocation for 'souvenirs' should be 15 euros
    And today's remaining allocation for 'entertainment' should be 10 euros

  Scenario: fixed daily limit and important category
    Given today's allocation for 'hotel' is 50 euros
    And today's allocation for 'food' is 70 euros
    And today's allocation for 'souvenirs' is 20 euros
    And spending is fixed
    And 'hotel' is important
    When I spend 100 euros on 'food'
    Then today's remaining budget should be 50 euros
    Then today's remaining allocation for 'hotel' should be 50 euros
    And today's remaining allocation for 'souvenirs' should be 0 euros
    And today's remaining allocation for 'food' should be 0 euros
