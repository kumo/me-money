Story: account warnings
  As a frequent spender
  I want to receive warnings when there are things to watch out for
  So that I can pro-actively deal with my money
  
  Scenario: no money in wallet
    Given an account named 'my wallet'
    And the account has a warning of 50 euros
    And the account has 0 euros in it
    When I view my dashboard
    Then I should see a warning for the wallet
  
  Scenario: less that 10% of limit
    Given an account named 'my wallet'
    And the account has a warning of 50 euros
    And the account has 52 euros in it
    When I view my dashboard
    Then I should see a warning for the wallet
  
  Scenario: not enough money left
    Given an account named 'my electronic key'
    And the account has 5 euro in it
    And I always spend at least 10 euros
    When I view my dashboard
    Then I should see a warning for the electronic key
