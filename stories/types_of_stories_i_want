* using an iphone and having quick access
* being able to throw in data quickly and verify/clean up later
* being warned about budget category being over spent
* treating budget categories in different ways -- some just have total amount, others have daily/weekly limits
* creating a zero based budget
* being able to adjust categories afterwards and deal with over/under spending
* bring extra money from one to another
* saving up for something over time
* reserving bits of income and so being told that money is not available

Now that I am on holiday I want:
* to hard allocate amounts of money -- hotel, travel, etc. and the rest can be flexible but perhaps stil have minimums (e.g. food)
* link categories together so that money left over from one can be spent on the other or some sort of "melting pot" that categories can draw from. e.g. I want to allocate â‚¬100 a day for food, entertainment, and souvenirs. Everything has an amount, but money left over from one can be spent on the other such as less food means more souvenirs. at end of the end left over money can be moved to a melting pot so that one can eat out in style one day or buy that big souvenir
