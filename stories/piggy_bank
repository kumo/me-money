Story: using piggy bank
  As a saver
  I want to put money in a piggy bank
  So that I can spend it someday
  
  Scenario: piggy bank has a goal
    Given a piggy bank named 'Holiday'
    And the piggy bank has a goal of 300 euros
    When I add 50 euros to the piggy bank
    Then I should now have 50 euros in the piggy bank
    And I should have 250 euros to go
    And the piggy bank goal should not be reached
  
  Scenario: some money has been allocated towards goal
    Given a piggy bank named 'Holiday'
    And the piggy bank has a goal of 300 euros
    And the piggy bank has 150 euros in it
    When I allocate 100 euros to 'travel'
    Then I should still have 150 euros in the piggy bank
    Then I should have 150 euros to go
    And the piggy bank goal should not be reached
  
  Scenario: goal reached
    Given a piggy bank named 'Holiday'
    And the piggy bank has a goal of 300 euros
    And the piggy bank has 250 euros in it
    When I add 50 euros to the piggy bank
    Then I should now have 300 euros in the piggy bank
    And I should have 0 euros to go
    And the piggy bank goal should be reached
  
  Scenario: no goal
    Given a piggy bank named 'Holiday'
    And the piggy bank has 100 euros in it
    When I add 200 euros to the piggy bank
    Then I should now have 300 euros in the piggy bank
    And the piggy bank should not have a goal
