Story: checking a budget
  As an account holder
  I want to know how much money I have in each budget
  So that I don't spend all my money

  Scenario: freshly started
    Given the budget balance is 100 euros
    And the budget lasts 10 days
    When I start the budget
    Then my daily balance is 10 euros
  
  Scenario: spending less than allocated daily
    Given my budget balance is 100 euros
    And the budget lasts 10 days
    And I am on day 1 of the budget
    When I spend 5 euros
    Then my remaining daily balance is 5 euros
    And my budget balance is 95 euros
    And the daily balance is 10 euros
  
  Scenario: spending daily allocated money
    Given my budget balance is 100 euros
    And the budget lasts 10 days
    And I am on day 1 of the budget
    When I spend 10 euros
    Then my remaining daily balance is 0 euros
    And my budget balance is 90 euros
    And the daily balance is 10 euros
    
  Scenario: spending more than allocated daily
    Given my budget balance is 100 euros
    And the budget lasts 10 days
    And I am on day 1 of the budget
    When I spend 15 euros
    Then my budget balance is 85 euros
    And my remaining daily balance is 0 euros
    And the daily balance is not 10 euros
