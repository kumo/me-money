Story: assigning dates to a budget
  As a budget creator
  I want to assign a starting and ending date to a budget
  So that I can track over a certain period
  
  Scenario: starts today
    Given a budget starting today
    And the budget ends tomorrow
    When I view the budget
    Then I should see that the budget is in progress
    And I should see that the budget lasts 2 days
    And I should see that I am on day 1 of the budget
    
  Scenario: already started
    Given a budget starting yesterday
    And the budget ends tomorrow
    When I view the budget
    Then I should see that the budget is in progress
    And I should see that the budget lasts 3 days
    And I should see that I am on day 2 of the budget
    
  Scenario: finished
    Given a budget starting 2 days ago
    And the budget ends yesterday
    When I view the budget
    Then I should see that the budget has finished
    And I should see that the budget lasts 2 days
  
  Scenario: not yet started
    Given a budget starting tomorrow
    And the budget ends in 5 days
    When I view the budget
    Then I should see that the budget hasn't started yet
    And I should see that the budget lasts 5 days
