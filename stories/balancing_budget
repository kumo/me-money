Story: balancing a budget
  As a spender
  I want to be able to balance a budget over time
  So that I can respond to my spending
  
  Scenario: overspent in a budget category
    Given a budget with an income of 100 euros
    And the budget has a 'food' budget category of 20 euros
    And the budget has an 'entertainment' budget category of 80 euros
    And I have spent 40 euros in the 'food' budget category
    And I have spent 20 euros in the 'entertainment' budget category
    When I balance the budget
    Then I should see that the 'food' budget category differs by 20 euros
    And I should see that the budget is imbalanced by -20 euros
    And I should see a 'budget needs adjusting' warning message
  
  Scenario: minimum amounts
    Given a budget with an income of 100 euros
    And the budget has a 'food' budget category of 20 euros
    And the budget has an 'entertainment' budget category of 80 euros
    And I have spent 20 euros in the 'food' budget category
    And I have spent 50 euros in the 'entertainment' budget category
    When I balance the budget
    Then I should see that the 'food' budget category cannot go below 20 euros
    And I should see that the 'entertainment' budget category cannot go below 50 euros
    And I should see that 70 euros has already been spent

  Scenario: automatic categories
    Given a budget with an income of 100 euros
    And the budget has a 'car payment' automatic budget category of 20 euros
    And the budget has an 'entertainment' budget category of 80 euros
    And I have spent 0 euros in the 'food' budget category
    And I have spent 50 euros in the 'entertainment' budget category
    When I balance the budget
    Then I should see that the 'car payment' budget category cannot go below 20 euros
    And I should see that the 'entertainment' budget category cannot go below 50 euros
    And I should see that 70 euros has already been allocated
    And I should see that 50 euros has already been spent
