Story: bringing forward a budget
  As a budget creator
  I want to bring unspent money from one budget to another
  So that I always know where my money has gone
  
  Scenario: nothing left over
    Given a budget with an income of 100 euros
    And the budget has a 'food' budget category of 20 euros
    And the budget has an 'entertainment' budget category of 80 euros
    And I have spent 20 euros in the 'food' budget category
    And I have spent 80 euros in the 'entertainment' budget category
    When I create a new budget from the existing budget
    Then I should see that 0 euros have been brought over
    
  Scenario: some money left over

    And I have spent 10 euros in the 'food' budget category
