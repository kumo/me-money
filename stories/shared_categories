Story: shared categories
  As a traveller
  I want to share funds between certain categories
  So that I can spend different amounts on different days
  
  Scenario: shared categories
    Given today's allocation for 'food' is 70 euros
    And today's allocation for 'souvenirs' is 20 euros
    And today's allocation for 'entertainment' is 30 euros
    And 'food' are shared
    And 'souvenirs' are shared
    Then today's shared allocation should be 90 euros

  Scenario: over spending in shared categories
    Given today's allocation for 'food' is 70 euros
    And today's allocation for 'souvenirs' is 20 euros
    And today's allocation for 'entertainment' is 20 euros
    And 'food' are shared
    And 'souvenirs' are shared
    And 'entertainment' are shared
    When I spend 80 euros on 'food'
    Then today's shared allocation should be 10 euros
    And today's remaining allocation for 'souvenirs' should be 15 euros
    And today's remaining allocation for 'entertainment' should be 15 euros

  Scenario: under spending in shared categories
    Given today's allocation for 'food' is 70 euros
    And today's allocation for 'souvenirs' is 20 euros
    And today's allocation for 'entertainment' is 20 euros
    And 'souvenirs' are shared with 'food'
    And 'entertainment' are shared with 'food'
    When I spend 50 euros on 'food'
    Then today's shared allocation should be 60 euros
    And today's remaining allocation for 'souvenirs' should be 30 euros
    And today's remaining allocation for 'entertainment' should be 30 euros
