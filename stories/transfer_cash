Story: transfer to cash account
  As a savings account holder
  I want to transfer money from my savings account
  So that I can get cash easily from an ATM

  Scenario: savings account is in credit
    Given my savings account balance is 100 euros
    And my cash account balance is 10 euros
    When I transfer 20 euros
    Then my savings account balance should be 80 euros
    And my cash account balance should be 30 euros

  Scenario: savings account is overdrawn
    Given my savings account balance is -20 euros
    And my cash account balance is 10 euros
    When I transfer 20 euros
    Then my savings account balance should be -20 euros
    And my cash account balance should be 10 euros
