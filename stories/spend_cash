Story: spend cash
  As a savings account holder
  I want to spend money in my wallet
  So that I can buy some things

  Scenario: wallet has money
    Given my wallet balance is 100 euros
    When I spend 20 euros
    Then my wallet balance should be 80 euros

  Scenario: wallet has no money
    Given my wallet balance is 0 euros
    When I spend 10 euros
    Then my wallet balance should be -10 euros
    And I should see an error message
