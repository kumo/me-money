Story: spend cash
  As a savings account holder
  I want to spend money in my wallet
  So that I can buy some things

  Scenario: wallet has money
    Given an account named 'my wallet'
    And the account has 100 euros in it
    When I spend 20 euros
    Then I should see the list of entries
    And the account balance should now be 80 euros

  Scenario: wallet has no money
    Given an account named 'my wallet'
    And the account has 0 euros in it
    When I spend 10 euros
    Then I should see the list of entries
    And the account balance should now be -10 euros
