Story: viewing the dashboard
  As a money tracker
  I want quick access to my situation
  So that I don't lose my momentum
  
  Scenario: no accounts
    Given I have no accounts
    When I view my dashboard
    Then I should see a no_accounts message
    And I should see a link to create a new account
    And I should not see a new_entry form
  
  Scenario: one account
    Given an account named 'my wallet'
    When I view my dashboard
    Then I should see a new_entry form
    And I should not see the account list
    And I should see a hidden value with the account id
  
  Scenario: multiple accounts
    Given an account named 'my wallet'
    And an account named 'my pocket'
    When I view my dashboard
    Then I should see a new_entry form
    And I should see the account list
