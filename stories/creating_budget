Story: creating next month's budget
  As a budget creator
  I want to see be able to base next month's budget on this month
  So that I can quickly add the common information
  
  Scenario: piggy bank goal
    Given a piggy bank target of 100 euros
    When I want to create a new budget
    Then I should see the piggy bank category in the list of expenses
    And the piggy bank category should have 100 euros associated to it
    And there should be a check box next to the piggy bank category

  Scenario: overspent in a category
    Given a budget with a 'food' budget category of 20 euros
    And I have spent 40 euros in the 'food' budget category
    When I want to create a new budget
    Then I should see the 'food' budget category in the list of expenses
    And the 'food' budget category should have 60 euros associated to it
    And there should be a check box next to the 'food' budget category
